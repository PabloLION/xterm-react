# Project Brief: XTerm React Modernization

## Executive Summary

XTerm React provides a modern React wrapper around the xterm.js terminal emulator for teams that need an embeddable, fully featured terminal surface. The current effort focuses on hardening the library for React 18/19 + TypeScript 5.x consumers, backed by an in-repo compatibility harness and clearer release tooling, so downstream products can depend on predictable behavior and verified ecosystem support.

## Problem Statement

- The ecosystem’s reference wrapper (`xterm-for-react`) is stagnant, leaving teams to hand-roll integrations or pin outdated dependencies.
- Prior to recent work, this project lacked automated compatibility verification, consistent release packaging, and authoritative documentation, making regressions easy to ship.
- Consumers have little guidance on supported combinations (React/TypeScript/lint tooling) and must run ad-hoc validation themselves.
- Upcoming React 19 adoption raises the urgency to provide a well-tested, actively maintained alternative.

## Proposed Solution

- Maintain XTerm React as the canonical React 18/19 wrapper with a published npm package (`@pablo-lion/xterm-react`) and ESM-friendly exports.
- Leverage the new consumer-app–driven compatibility matrix so each release is validated against curated React/TypeScript/linting combinations.
- Expand documentation (usage, addons, release flow) and automate history/summary generation for transparency.
- Evolve tooling so the library can be consumed by both JavaScript and TypeScript apps with minimal setup friction.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: React product teams embedding terminals

- Profile: SaaS/enterprise teams building developer consoles, remote shells, or simulation tools.
- Behaviors: Integrate terminals inside dashboards, rely on React Suspense, bundlers like Vite/Webpack, and TypeScript-first codebases.
- Needs: Stable APIs, modern hook/component patterns, compatibility assurances, and addon guidance (fit, search, etc.).
- Goals: Ship terminal-driven features without becoming xterm.js experts.

### Secondary User Segment: Library maintainers & OSS contributors

- Profile: Developers enhancing or forking terminal wrappers for specialized use cases.
- Behaviors: Evaluate terminal APIs, contribute patches, publish downstream packages.
- Needs: Clear architecture docs, tests, release process, and contribution guidelines.
- Goals: Extend functionality (addons, status bar overlays) without breaking core contracts.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives

- Keep the React 18/19 + TypeScript 5.x wrapper reliable and easy to consume.
- Prevent regressions by enforcing the curated compatibility matrix on every release.
- Provide authoritative docs so consumers can integrate without guesswork.

### User Success Metrics

- Compatibility matrix remains fully green (`PASS` for all curated scenarios) before publishing.
- Docs (README + deeper guides) update alongside any API or tooling change.
- Consumers can install the npm package in a fresh React 19 + TS 5 app with zero manual overrides.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Matrix Health:** `PASS` vs `FAIL` counts in `MATRIX_SUMMARY.md` per run (target: 100% pass rate on curated set).
- **Doc Freshness:** Number of releases where README/docs updates land in the same PR/commit as the feature.
- **Release Hygiene:** Instances of package install issues reported post-release (target: 0).

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Baseline Achieved)

- **Compatibility Harness**: Curated matrix (`pnpm compat:matrix`) covering React 18.3.x & 19.1.x with TypeScript 5.2/5.4/5.9 and Biome lint family.
- **ESM Packaging Hygiene**: `package.json` exposes `type`, `exports`, and `sideEffects` for bundler compatibility.
- **Docs Refresh**: README + `docs/compatibility-testing.md` describe usage, matrix workflow, and release steps.

### Current Focus (Beyond MVP)

- Dual consumer apps (JS + TS) with automation so we can test both ecosystems consistently.
- PRD/architecture/doc system built via BMAD (existing docs need consolidation with new templates).
- Compatibility enhancements (lint family backlog, skip logic, notifications) prioritized via revival plan.

### Baseline Success Criteria

- Matrix runs report zero unexpected failures prior to publish.
- npm install works cleanly in a React 19 + TypeScript 5 starter without overrides.
- Documentation surface (README → docs/) stays synchronized with releases.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features

- Dual consumer apps (JS + TS) with shared scaffolding and quick matrix filters.
- Consolidated documentation system (merge legacy docs with BMAD outputs, define navigation).
- Optional addon catalogue (FitAddon, ligatures, web links) with recipes.
- Notification pipeline that posts matrix summaries to PRs or Slack.

### Long-term Vision

- Fully scripted release workflow with automated PRD/history artifacts.
- Extended compatibility to React 20 and emerging lint/format tools.
- Optional hosted playground demonstrating multiple terminal presets.

### Expansion Opportunities

- Authoring a `useXTerm` hook helper if demand surfaces.
- Offering preset themes/status bar overlays for product differentiation.
- Publishing BMAD-driven planning artifacts for community collaboration.

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

- **Target Platforms:** React 18/19 web applications (SPA/SSR).
- **Browser/OS Support:** Modern evergreen browsers and Electron shells.
- **Performance Requirements:** Terminal initialization <100ms in consumer demo; write throughput driven primarily by xterm.js.

### Technology Preferences

- **Frontend:** TypeScript + React, Vite dev harness.
- **Backend:** N/A (library only) — sample consumer uses Vite bundler.
- **Database:** None.
- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** GitHub Actions for CI, npm registry for distribution.

### Architecture Considerations

- **Repository Structure:** `src/` library, `version-compatibility-tests/` harness, `docs/` for guidance.
- **Service Architecture:** N/A library; consumer app built via scripts.
- **Integration Requirements:** Consumers supply own xterm.js configuration and addons.
- **Security/Compliance:** Ensure no secrets included; respect package sideEffects for tree-shaking.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Budget:** OSS volunteer bandwidth (no dedicated funding).
- **Timeline:** Iterative; target 1.2.x stabilization through Q4 2025.
- **Resources:** Primarily maintained by Pablo; community contributions welcome.
- **Technical:** Must align with React 18+/TypeScript 5+, Node 18+; keep footprint slim for library consumers.

### Key Assumptions

- Community needs a modern, well-documented terminal component.
- React 17 support is intentionally dropped—no regression expected.
- BMAD artifacts (PRD, architecture) will be produced as we iterate.

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Matrix Runtime Cost:** Large scenario sets may slow CI; mitigated by curated subsets and future skip logic.
- **Documentation Debt:** Without dedicated cycles, docs may lag features, confusing adopters.
- **Dual Consumer Strategy:** Maintaining both JS and TS demos could double support burden if not automated.

### Open Questions

- Which backlog items (addons, notifications, history) get priority for the next release?
- Do we need backwards compatibility bridges for React 17 enterprise consumers?
- How should we surface compatibility results to users (badges, dashboards, release notes)?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- Benchmarks for large terminal workloads under React 19.
- Integration stories for server-driven terminals and hosted environments.
- User feedback on desired addon coverage or hook APIs.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. Confirm priorities among backlog items (dual consumer apps, doc-system merge, notification tooling).
2. Produce PRD using BMAD PRD template seeded by this brief.
3. Audit compatibility matrix runtime and consider skip logic or quick mode defaults.
4. Draft addon/status-bar documentation outline for community review.
