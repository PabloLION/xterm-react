# Development Logs

Chronological records for plans and retrospective notes tied to the product roadmap. Organize new entries by epic so contributors can trace decisions quickly.

## Usage Guidelines

- Create a new log for each significant feature, refactor, or implementation effort.
- Keep logs updated during development and migrate durable decisions into long-term docs when work ships.
- Name files with an ISO date prefix (`YYYYMMDD-slug.md`) so entries sort chronologically.
- Include an **Atomic Commit Breakdown** section in every plan before implementation starts.
